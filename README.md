# Jactorio

My attempt at recreating [Factorio](https://factorio.com), inspired by [Hopson98's recreation of Minecraft](https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge)

## Building

**Build types:** `Debug, Release`

### Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/jaihysc/Jactorio.git
cd Jactorio
sh ./build.sh **See build types above**
```

Executable will be placed in `out/src/`

## Work in progress

This is nowhere near ready for usage, this will be updated as conditions change
